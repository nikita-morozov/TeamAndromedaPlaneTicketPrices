# TeamAndromedaPlaneTicketPrices
The following project will use a live flight price API to track cost trends of plane tickets. Using the data we gain, we will be able to visualize when a specific ticket should be bought and show the user how good of a price they are getting if they decide to buy on any given day. Our purpose is to optimize a user’s ability to get a ticket for the best price. We will construct an interface that’s helps users decide if it is a good time to buy the tickets. This system might serve as a foundation for a more intricate process of purchasing in the future.
